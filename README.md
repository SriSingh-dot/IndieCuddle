The Indie Species

The Indie Species is a heartfelt website created to raise awareness about Indian Indie dogs—our country’s own loyal companions who are often mislabeled as “strays.” The site shares information about Supreme Court rulings, ways to help, and a gallery celebrating Indies, while promoting compassion and responsible action toward these amazing animals.

While making this project i was sitting in balcony watching over 5 puppies playing,biting and tripping over.They literally looks like cute meat balls rolling down the street.
I always wanted to have one but cannot because of my mother.The hypocrisy is that she herself had three dogs when she was younger.

This site is not just to give you information about the court orders but to also encourage and teach you that they also deserve love as a living being.No one in this world is worthy of any hate without any reason,that's how our gods made us.
